            <p class="aboutme"> Hi! My name is REDACTED. Currently, I am a junior studying computer science at Brown University in Providence, RI. In the past, I have worked on multiple design projects developing skills such as responsive design and react development. I have also worked on the development of multiple projects at [name of company].  </p>
            <br>
            <p class="aboutme"> To me, designing is much more than just simply creating a service or platform. It is the complex conversation between a user and a designer that occurs as I come to understand what best suits a user. This conversation, this special combination of art and science, are all what attract me to design. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="aboutme"> I believe that good design is not just about making something look nice, but about creating a user experience that is intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable. As a designer, I strive to create products that are not only visually appealing, but also easy to use and understand. I am constantly looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date on the latest design trends and techniques. I am excited to see where my passion for design will take me in the future and to continue learning and growing as a designer. </p>
