  <h1>The Dryer Interface</h1>
  <div  class="intro">
    In this project, I observe the UX of a dryer. To accomplish this I will start by describing the interface and then go on to question current users. Finally, I will describe to possible User personas using a four-quadrant empathy map and create a storyboard based off what I have leaned.

  <h3>Part 1: The Dryer Interface</h3>
  
    <body>
    Here I have attached a sketch of the interface created in figma. On the left is an overview and on the right is a closeup of the interface. On the right you can see how the interface has multiple buttons for different setting and another button to start the dryer. There is also a timer display and two lights indicating the dryer cycle stage.

  <h3>Part 2: Observations and User Experiences</h3>
  <body>
    <h4 style="margin-top: 1%">Observations</h4>
    Throughout my observations I noticed that users tended to interact with the dryer in a very similar pattern. Hover over each user to find out what they were:
    <div class="user_profs">
      <div class="user_prof">
        <img class="prof_img" src="user.jpeg">
        <p class="prof_desc"> This user came down with a medium sized load of laundry which could be easily fit into one machine. After putting all of their clothes in one dryer, they pressed medium temp and then hit start. After noting the timer on the dryer they set also set one on their phone. When they came back their clothes were dry.</p> 
      </div>
      <div class="user_prof">
        <img class="prof_img" src="user.jpeg">
        <p class="prof_desc"> This user came down with a large load of laundry and barely fit it into one machine. After putting all of their clothes in one dryer, they pressed medium temp and then hit start. After noting the timer on the dryer they set also set one on their phone. When they came back their clothes were stil wet. They ran the dryer again on the same temperature. After the second time thier clothes were dry.</p> 
      </div><div class="user_prof">
        <img class="prof_img" src="user.jpeg">
        <p class="prof_desc"> This user came down with a medium sized load of laundry which could be fit into one machine. This user put most of their clothes in one dry pressed medium temp and start. Unlike the other users, they took out some of their delicates and put them into another dryer. They then pressed the delicates and then start buttons. When they came back they unload both fully dry loads.</p>

          2. Do you utilize the non-default temperature
        </summary>
        <p class="answer">Every person that I asked said they used the default temperature most of the time. One person said that sometimes if they have alarger load they will put the dryer on high temperature to make sure all of their clothes dry.

          3. Does anything frustrate you about this system and interface?
        </summary>
        <p class="answer">Two of the three people that I mentioned that they were frustrated over the lack of the options on the dryer. They said more options and buttons would better their ability to properly dry their cloths. The third user did not say anything frustrated them, but they did mention that they thought the no heat setting on the dryer was useless.</p>

          4. Does the interface give you sufficient control over the system?
        </summary>
        <p class="answer">All three of the users mentioned that they wanted to have more control over the amount of time their clothes were dried for. One said that small batches of clothes would sometime shrink from drying to much. A much bigger desire was for clothes to dry for a longer amount of time. Each user said that often when drying a large load of wash it would take more than one drying cycle to fully dry.</p>

          5. How do you think the system and interface work?
        </summary>
        <p class="answer">Two users said that they think the buttons heat up elements all around the dryer and the different buttons cause the elements to heat up different amounts. The third user thought that one heating element heated air which was blow into the dryer by a fan at different amounts depending on which button was pressed.</p>
